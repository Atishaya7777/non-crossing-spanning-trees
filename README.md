# Reconfiguration of spanning trees

Inspired by [Reconfiguration of Non-crossing Spanning Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03879), the Geometric, Approximation, and Distributed Algorithms (GADA) lab sought to try implementing and extending the results of reconfiguring non-crossing spanning trees. 

You can find the extent of the work in the .ipynb file inside the Scripts/ folder.
